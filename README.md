# Automations for my extremely personal use

This is a hobby project to send messages to the household with messages about what bin day it is, what day the Ringtons man is coming to sell us tea, etc. This is exclusively living on Github so I have an easier job if the raspberry pi dies (or I forget the password for it.....) so I can reinstate Binformation Bot and its friends.
